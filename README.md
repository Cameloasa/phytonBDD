# Online Bookstore BDD Project

## User Story 1
**As a** user of the online bookstore,  
**I want to** manage my shopping cart,  
**so that** I can purchase books easily.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The user can add a book to the cart, and the cart reflects the correct number of items.
2. If the user adds multiple copies of the same book, the cart groups them as a single item (e.g., "Book A - 2 copies").
3. The cart calculates the correct total amount after adding a book.
